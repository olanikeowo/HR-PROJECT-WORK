### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    This is an analysis of the Human Resources Dapartment. It is done by analyzing data using business 
    intelligence tool(PowerBI) to discover the key insights such as attrition rate,total number of current
    employeee, and job satisfaction rate. Thereafter, the dataset was being imported into Power Query for
    cleaning before the actual analysis was carried out in order to discover data-driven insights 
---
### DATA SOURCES
    The Data used for this project work is gotten from LITA Incubator Hub.The primary source of the Data is Data CSV 
    and it is an open source Data that can be freely downloadedfrom Kaggle or any other Data repository site.
---
### TOOLS USED
- PowerBI:
   - For Data Transformation
   - For Data Visualiazation
   - For Creating Interactive Dashboard
- Github for creating portfolio
 --- 
### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATIONS
  In the initial of the Data cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed;
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Data cleaning and formatting: This is where the Dataset was being transformed in Power Query to check the column quality,
     column distribution, column profile and Data type.
---
###  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
 The goal of this analysis is to produce an interactive PowerBI dashboard that highlights the following findings; 
  - Sum of attrition by department
  - Sum of attrition by Education field
  - Sum of aattrition by gender
  - Sum oif current employees by age band and gender
  - Attrition based on age groups and gender
---
### DATA ANALYSIS
 This is where DAX Function is used to calculate the following analysis:
   -Attrition rate using conditional column to know the number of employees that had left the organization. 
   -Job satisfaction rate was also calculated using conditional column.
  - Q&R AI Visual was used to perform some analysis such as Attrition Count, rate and so on.
  - Measure was used to generate the total revenue, percentage of attrition rate and average age.
---
 ### DATA VISUALIZATION
   The Key Insights are:
    - Attrition count and rate
    - Job satisfaction
    - Current employees

### INSIGHTS ANALYSIS
    - The gender with the highest sum of attrition count is male with the total number of 150 out of 237
    - The Edcucation field with the highest sum of attrition count is Life Science with the attrition count of 89 
    - The Edcucation field with the highest no of current employees is Bachelor's Degree which is the total of 473
    - The age band with the highest number of attrition count is  within the range of 25-34 with the attrition count of 112
    - The department with the highest number of attrition count is R&D with the total number of 133

    - The Dashboard to illustrate the findings:

### RECOMMENDATION
 Based on the analysis done, there is higher number of attrition count to current employees, I recommend, there should be an increase 
 in employees's salaries, necessary compensations should be given and regular communication with the employees to understand their concerns and
 address them to know if the organization's policies are bad.
